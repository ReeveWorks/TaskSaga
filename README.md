# TaskSaga

An Android application using .NET Framework where you turn your daily chores and tasks into an RPG-like quest. You can create skills that you want to develop and create tasks that will develop those skills. You can set the difficulty and rewards for each task you create.

# What I Learned

* I  learned that you can set a base value for the status of all the different elements.
* I can edit/create a color that I can reference in my elements, so I don't have to keep copying and pasting color codes.
